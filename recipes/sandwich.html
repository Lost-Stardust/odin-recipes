        <h3>Description</h3>

        <div class="p1">
          <p>Sandwich, in its basic form, slices of meat, cheese, or other food placed between two slices of bread. Although this mode of consumption must be as old as meat and bread, the name was adopted only in the 18th century for John Montagu, 4th earl of Sandwich.</p>
        
          <p>The United States contributed elaborate sandwich formulas, two of the most successful being the club sandwich of sliced chicken or turkey, bacon, lettuce, and tomato, and the Reuben sandwich of corned beef, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing served grilled on black bread. </p>
